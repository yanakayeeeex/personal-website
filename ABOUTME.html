            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p> Hello! My name is Alyana Kaye T. Ortiz. You can call me "Yana" or "Kaye" for 
                <br> short. I'm 20 years of age, born on September 12, 2002, in Quezon City. I like
                <br> solving math and designing. I planned to take Civil Engineering but unfortunately,
                <br> there was no slot left in Engineering Department. But then I dream to study at
                <br> PUP, so I take a risk to take another course which is BSIT, my fifth course.
                <br> And I think it's a grateful thing that happened to me during this Covid-19
                <br> pandemic, and I hoped it would be smooth this year as I thought it would go on
                <br> this year. After I graduate, I want to apply to a prestigious company as a Web 
                <br> Developer or System Analyst. If I can earn, I want to pursue my dream course
                <br> of Civil Engineering someday.
            </p>
